"""The gate-and-judge loop: run the stack, judge the style, revise, re-gate.

why this is ENGINE code (2026-09-05, VoiceLoop package extraction, slice 12). The
LOOP is the method. Gate the body, ask the style judge, hand the named violations to
a reviser, re-gate what comes back, and stop when it is clean or the budget is spent.
Every operator wants that shape. What differs between operators is WHICH gates, WHICH
judge and WHICH reviser, and none of those live here.

why the five dependencies are injected rather than imported. `decide` carries the ASK
roster, including a commercial price rule and a two-brand separation rule. Importing
it here would drag one practice's rules into the fleet package, which is the thing
this extraction exists to stop. So `decide`, `revise`, `voicefp_gate`,
`prompt_carried_for` and `_append_voice_provenance` arrive as keyword-only arguments.

`claude_bin`, `model` and `author` joined them on 2026-09-06 (slice 6b), when `revise`
moved into the package. The reviser shells a binary, names a tier and tells the model
whose voice to keep, and all three are the operator's: a default here would be one
machine's path, one operator's model choice and one operator's NAME shipped fleet-wide.
The exporter refuses an engine file carrying that name, which is how the third one was
found. They are threaded rather than bound on a shim because `pipeline.revise` has
to stay a plain `sys.modules` alias -- `reviser()`'s closure and the suite's
`monkeypatch.setattr(revise, "revise", ...)` must resolve to the SAME module object.

why they keep their original NAMES. The body below is byte-identical to the function
it was lifted from: 140 lines that decide when a post is finished, on the publishing
path, with a documented reason behind most of them. Renaming the references to
something tidier would have meant editing every one of those lines, and a diff where
every line moved is a diff nobody can review. The parameters are named `decide` and
`revise` because the code says `decide.decide_candidate` and `revise.reviser`, and
that is worth more than a naming convention.

The deployment's `cycle._gate_and_judge` binds the five and calls through, so
`run_slot` and its three invariants were not touched.

    why this is a function (2026-09-02, founder-directed: "ensure that all tests that
    run on x and linkedin run here. The mechanism needs to be mirrored"): the reddit
    lane was built as its own contract and ran NONE of this -- not `bio_gate`, not
    `ending_gate`, not `figure_gate`, not `assistant_gate`, not the style loop, not the
    fingerprint -- because the PRD non-goal that correctly barred X's FORMAT gates from
    reddit was read as barring the whole stack (from a real defect). The body of this helper
    is `draft_from_idea`'s own, moved verbatim; the lane that wrote posts and the lane
    that writes reddit now call the same code, so a gate added here reaches both. A
    second copy is where the reddit copy would have drifted again.

    Channel-coupled gates stay channel-coupled INSIDE the stack: `x_format` is silent
    off x, `substance_gate` reads its floor per channel. Nothing here is skipped by
    channel; the stack skips itself where a rule does not apply.
