"""The second stage: judge ONE constraint per model call, then revise what failed.

why this exists (2026-08-12, an earlier fix, plan `two-stage-writer-critic-2026-08-12.md`):
`build_prompt` rendered 25 to 40 constraints into a single instruction. Compliance
research (arXiv 2608.02639) measures obedience collapsing past roughly 20 stacked
constraints, and the drops are SILENT -- each draft obeys a different random subset. That
is the mechanism behind three rounds of the founder rejecting batches on properties the
prompt demonstrably carried: rendering the prompt proved the WORDS were there, which is
exactly the evidence RULE-2026-08-12-H says never tests the behaviour.

DeCRIM (arXiv 2410.06458) is the shape used here: decompose, critique, refine. So the
writer carries six constraints and everything else is judged HERE, one constraint per
call, against the draft the deterministic gates already passed.

## Where this sits, and why not one step earlier or later

`cycle.run_slot` calls this AFTER `decide_slot` returns a SHIPPABLE verdict. Two rejected
placements, kept so the choice is not re-derived:

- inside `decide._violations`: the gate census is counted from the AST and must stay
  honest at 15 deterministic checks. A model verdict in that list muddies both.
- before the gates in `prepare_candidate`: spends model calls on drafts the free
  deterministic gates may discard anyway, and gate REPAIR can alter text after the
  critic passed it, so the critic would have judged something that never shipped.

## The two fail directions, deliberately asymmetric

A malformed critic answer must not silently pass a QUALITY question (does it tell a
story, is he in it, is there something to catch the reader) -- those are the three the
founder's read fails on, so an unparseable verdict there fails CLOSED. On a STYLE row it
fails OPEN with a warn row, because a style constraint that cannot be parsed must not
kill supply; `decide_slot` raising IndexError on an empty supply is a dead slot, and a
dead slot is the founder-facing terminal state `decide.py` exists to forbid.

## One judgment per row (the checklist owner's standing rule, addendum 4, 2026-08-12)

A row states ONE positive fact required, as a yes/no, with no escape clause riding
along inside it. No compound "does the draft do X, rather than Y" and no required
positive test sharing a row with a prohibition.

The measurement behind it: banked draft `070c04d8` passed 13 of 13 rows and the founder
refused it, and three of those rows shared that compound shape. A model can satisfy the
weak half (no pitch, some kind of stance) and return a pass with the hard half never
present. That is the stacking failure this whole stage exists to escape, recreated one
level down inside a single row. Interpretive, so it lives here and not in a lint: the
tightened rows still use "rather than" to NAME a failure mode, which is fine, and a
regex cannot tell that from an escape hatch.

## The checklist is data, read every render

The checklist file is the operator's, verbatim, and it is READ on every review
rather than held as constants -- RULE-2026-08-12-F's corollary, the same wiring
`config/channel-guidance.json` has, so an edit provably changes what is judged. A missing
file degrades LOUD AND OPEN: nothing is judged, one warn row lands in the log, and the
notify sink is told. It cannot become the quiet normal because
`test_critic.py::TestTheLiveChecklistIsPresentAndPopulated` fails the suite when the real
file goes missing -- the same blocker `post_jobs` carries for the same reason.

# THE TWO PATHS ARE NOT HERE, and that is the whole shape of this module's extraction
# (2026-09-06, VoiceLoop package extraction, slice 6b). The checklist a critic judges
# against and the ledger it writes to are the OPERATOR'S: one is a named person's list
# of constraints, the other is that person's receipt log. A fleet package that resolved
# either from its own __file__ would point every instance at whichever machine the
# package happened to be installed on.
#
# So every function that used to fall back to a module constant now REQUIRES the path,
# and `pipeline/critic.py` is the adapter that supplies both. The engine raising is
# deliberate and is the opposite of what the old default did: `load_checklist` answers
# [] on a read failure, which means "nothing was judged", and a moved path used to
# arrive as that same silent []. A missing argument is a wiring bug, not a data
# outcome, and it says so.
#
# An ADAPTER is safe here where `revise` needed an alias: nothing resolves a patched
# module-global through a closure in this file. The only monkeypatch the suite aims at
# critic is the model chokepoint, which is `prompt_render.run_model` and lives in
# neither namespace. `test_adapter_surface.py` holds both halves.

# Bounded, and the bound is the point. An unbounded critique/revise loop against a
# constraint the model cannot satisfy is the capitalization scar with a model on both
# ends: `decide.py` already carries the measurement (a gate the repair ladder cannot
# satisfy does not reject a post, it kills the slot after 1083 model calls).

    THE VACUOUS-PRECONDITION LINE (2026-08-13), and it is a measured fix rather than a
    tidy one. On the first live batch, two of two candidates were failed by
    `tenure-naturalness` because no tenure appeared in the post at all. That row asks
    what must be true WHEN his tenure appears; a post with none satisfies it. Failing it
    inverts the rule into "every post must carry a credential", the opposite of what
    RULE-2026-08-12-F ruled, and candidate 2 passed 11 of 13 and died on it.

    FOUR rows are conditional, not three: `tenure-naturalness`, both external-incident
    rows, and `ending-discipline` ("If the ending reaches for..."), which the first count
    here missed. The live batch only hit the tenure one; the other three were latent, and

    without someone noticing, and a self-enumerating guard there rescans the checklist
    for precondition openers and fails if it finds one the list does not name.

    The constraint sentence is the operator's, verbatim from the checklist. Everything around it
    is scaffolding and shows no worked sentence, because a quoted finished sentence here
    is one a reviser can copy into a post. The executable that catches it is
    `pipeline/tests/test_critic.py::test_the_critic_prompt_shows_no_worked_example`, which

    `regate(text) -> (repaired_text, blocking_violations)` is supplied by the caller and
    is `decide.assess` with the slot's own arguments. It is required for revision:
    without it a critic-driven revision would ship without re-entering the 15
    deterministic gates, which is the one thing the placement fork was picked to prevent.

    THE SHIPPED TEXT IS THE JUDGED TEXT. This returns either the string it was handed or
    a string `reviser` produced and `regate` then cleared. The critic's rationale flows
    only into the log rows. `test_critic_rationale_never_reaches_the_body` drives it.

    A revision the gates reject is a DISCARD, not another attempt: re-running the same
    prompt against the same text is the identical-retry this repo already bans, and the
    slot refills from the next candidate in the same cycle.
