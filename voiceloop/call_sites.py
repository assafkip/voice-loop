"""Find every file that shells the headless model itself instead of using the wrapper.

why (an earlier fix, Step 2 of the ticket-flood plan). `prompt_render.run_model` is the
metered chokepoint: one ledger row per call. A script that runs `claude -p` on
its own is invisible to that ledger, and on 2026-09-12, when the fleet hit the
weekly limit, nothing could say which bot had spent it. This module is the
detector an inventory test holds a tree against; the inventory itself (which
sites are tolerated, and why) belongs to the deployment, never to the engine.

WHAT IT SEES, and what it does not, stated so its silence reads right:
  .py  a file that names `claude` somewhere AND holds an argv list or tuple
       literal with the string "-p" either first (`DEFAULT_ARGS = ["-p", ...]`,
       the binary prepended elsewhere) or right after an expression standing
       for the binary: a string ending in `claude`, a variable, an attribute,
       a call, or a conditional such as `CLAUDE_BIN if ... else "claude"`.
       `--print`, the long spelling, counts the same as `-p`.
       The `claude` mention is what keeps `[ssh_bin, "-p", port]` out (a review
       round 1 minor 2); a file that shells both ssh and the model is counted,
       which is the right side to err on. A caller that assembles `claude -p`
       inside a shell string is NOT seen. A file this Python cannot parse
       falls back to the text shape of the argv element.
  .sh  a logical line (backslash continuations joined) split at pipes and
       list operators outside quotes; a segment counts when the token in
       command position (past `NAME=value` and known wrappers such as env,
       nohup, timeout, sudo with its -u value, xargs with its -I value) is
       `claude`, a path ending in `/claude`, or a `$CLAUDE*` variable, and a
       later token in the segment is exactly -p or --print. A shell's -c
       string is scanned the same way, which is how a worker loop calls it
       through a wrapper function of its own. An `echo`/`printf` line skips
       only its first segment, so `echo "$p" | claude --print` counts and
       `echo 'a; claude -p x'` does not; `sudo -u claude run.sh -p` is a
       service account, not a call. Linear time. A heredoc body that quotes
       the pattern IS counted: this scanner does not parse heredocs, and it
       errs toward a row a reason explains.
Test directories are skipped: a test that spends a real call is a token
problem, not a metering one, and their fixtures quote the pattern in prose.
Review scratch trees (`.review-*`) hold copies of the scripts and are not
runtime.
