"""Print the voice reference for ONE piece of writing. A CALLER, not a selector.

Every decision belongs to voiceloop: `assemble.voice_section` builds the section
(identity, pov, lexicon, correction SCOPES, exemplars) and `selector` decides which
rows ride in it. This file resolves the corpus, asks, and prints.

why the boundary is stated this hard: version one of this file WAS a second
selector with its own rotation and its own random sampling, written before I found
voiceloop. Version two still rebuilt identity and corrections by hand, which quietly
dropped correction `scope` -- a correction withheld from the model was still shown.
Both are the same shape as two voice corpora, which took a night to kill
(an earlier fix, 2026-08-13). A duplicate that agrees today is still a duplicate.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/voice_ref.py --channel x --words 480   # long-form register
    python3 scripts/voice_ref.py --channel x --words 25    # DM / comment register
    python3 scripts/voice_ref.py --channel linkedin --words 200
    python3 scripts/voice_ref.py --channel x --words 480 --ids-only
