"""The channel vocabulary this engine validates against, and its ONE owner.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (an earlier fix, measured 2026-08-30). `validate.py` restated
channel membership FOUR times in one file: the correction-scope allowlist, the
`check_pools` loop, `CHECKED_SLOTS`, and `check_budget`'s default. A founder
correction scoped to "reddit" was refused by the first of those, and the fleet
had eighteen hardcoded channel sites for the same reason. Adding "reddit" to the
allowlist would have made it the nineteenth site and left three more disagreeing
inside the same file. Shotgun Surgery has a named cure and it is not one more
literal: derive the value from its owner.

TWO AXES, NOT ONE. Collapsing them is the same defect one level in.

- SCOPE: which channel names a correction may be scoped to. Seven today.
- ASSEMBLED: which channels the assembler actually builds a prompt for, so which
  ones must clear the pool floor, the anchor-rotation floor and the char budget.
  Two today. A channel can be a legal correction scope without owning a pool --
  reddit is exactly that case, and a registry that could not say so would put
  reddit into `check_pools` and turn 27 corpora red for a pool nobody assembles.

THE HARD CONSTRAINT, and it outranks the feature. An instance with NO registry
must behave byte-identically to before this module existed. 27 instances load
this code and none of them asked for a registry. So `DEFAULT` below is today's
literals verbatim, `resolve()` returning None is the normal case, and every
`channels=None` default in validate.py lands here. `test_channel_registry.py`
pins that with the pre-change literals written out independently, so a future
edit to DEFAULT is caught by a test that does not import DEFAULT.

RESOLUTION SHAPE IS COPIED, NOT INVENTED. `resolve()` is the same two-source
shape as `resolve_channel_registry` in q-system/.q-system/scripts/voice-stop-gate.py,
which itself copied `resolve_reporter` beside it. Same relative paths, same
pointer-file semantics, same "return the named path even when it is missing" rule.
an earlier fix tracks collapsing those copies into one importable home; this module
is that home for everything that can import the voice engine. The Stop-gate's
copy is deliberately NOT collapsed into it here: that hook is fail-closed on every
turn of 27 instances, this package's directory name is mid-rename across the
fleet, and an import that resolved to the old name would hold every turn on every
instance that has not synced yet. That collapse waits for the rename to land
and for the schema-conformance fixture an earlier fix asks for.

FAIL-CLOSED, same posture as the rest of this package's validate half. A registry
that is PRESENT and untrustworthy raises rather than falling back to DEFAULT.
Falling back would silently grade a corpus against the wrong vocabulary, which is
the entire defect the registry exists to prevent.
