"""Style fingerprint: measurable voice, computed from a corpus, scored on a candidate.

why this exists (2026-08-06): a 55k-char prose style guide shipped in every generation
prompt and the founder still read the output as "missing my voice as a grumpy engineer".
Prose describing a distribution is a region; only numbers computed FROM the writing can
say whether a candidate sits inside it. This module is the instrument: `compute()` builds
percentile bands from real exemplars, `score()` reports where a candidate falls.

Everything is pure text ops -- no model, no network, no clock. The metric set is the
deterministic slice of the voice only. Whether a scar is true, whether a coined name is
good, whether the humor lands: none of that is here, and any claim that a script scores
"voice authenticity" would be prompt-only enforcement wearing a script's name.

Band semantics: p10/p90 over the corpus, per metric. A candidate outside a band is
FLAGGED, not judged -- the caller decides which metrics block (tight bands plus a known
generator failure direction) and which stay advisory (real signal, too noisy to block on).
That tiering lives in the instance's fingerprint.json, not in code, because the corpus
owner is the one who can see false positives: a voice gate that rejects the founder's own
writing gets switched off, which protects nothing.

# does not. Caught by a revieweron a review as a major, and the trigger was already
# written one line up ("a new regex") -- the rule existed, I changed a regex, and
# I did not apply it. Exactly the plugin-version-bump gate an hour earlier: a
# version key exists so a changed meaning invalidates the cached calibration, and
# skipping the bump makes stale data look fresh against a BLOCKING gate that runs
# unattended.
# 3 -> 4: the (?i: ...) scoped flag above changed what first_person_rate COUNTS
