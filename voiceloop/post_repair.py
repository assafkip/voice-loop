"""Deterministic repair of a draft BEFORE the voice gate sees it.

why this exists (2026-08-05, an earlier fix): the content engine stopped shipping because
`check_capitalization()` blocks on a lowercase sentence start, and three live incidents
tripped it on tokens whose CORRECT spelling is lowercase -- the tool names `ratchet` and
`acontext`, and lines starting `https://`. The regenerate loop asked a model to "fix"
correct names three times and fail-closed. Three failures, nothing shipped.

**A gate that can only be cleared by producing something wrong is not a gate, it is a
stop.** This module is the missing layer: it repairs what is genuinely wrong and PROTECTS
what is genuinely right, deterministically, before any model is asked to regenerate.

The layering it belongs to (PRD prd-content-engine-2026-08-04):

    deterministic repair (here) -> gate -> bounded LLM regenerate -> terminal action

Two design rules, both load-bearing:

1. **It imports the linter's own helpers rather than reimplementing them.** If this module
   had its own idea of where a sentence starts, the repairer and the gate would drift and
   the drift would look like a flaky gate. The linter is the single source of truth for
   what a violation IS; this module only decides what to DO about one.
2. **A token whose correct form is lowercase is never recapitalized.** It is wrapped in
   backticks instead, which is both correct markdown and the thing that makes the linter
   skip it (`INLINE_CODE_RE` -> `__CODE__`). The repair makes the text MORE correct, never
   less, which is why it is safe to run unattended.

Scope (widened 2026-08-05, founder-directed): every violation whose fix is a pure
textual transform with exactly one correct answer. Capitalization, emdashes, slash
commands, non-contracted negations, the safe banned-word substitutions, and the pure
transition adverbs. The founder's rule, verbatim: "you dont need to kill posts that have
a fail, just fix the fail if possible. you are narrowing your own set by killing a full
post over capitalization." Anything needing the text's MEANING (a stat's source, a
mechanism, a rephrase) goes to the bounded targeted revision in `revise.py` instead;
this module must never guess at meaning, because a deterministic layer that guesses is
a second voice system wearing a script.

# This module used to resolve four files from __file__: a verbatim-lowercase
# allowlist, a banned-word repair map, an extra banned-phrase list, and the voice
# linter script itself. Inside one deployment that is correct and invisible. Inside
# a package that ships fleet-wide it silently points every operator at whichever
# files happen to sit beside the code, which is the failure `voice_ref` already
# refuses by carrying no default corpus at all, and which `experience.match` refuses
# by taking its corpus directory as a required argument.
#
# So every loader below takes its path, and every entry point takes its data. There
# is no default and no fallback: a caller that forgets is a TypeError at the call
# site, never a silent read of the wrong operator's config. The deployment half is
# the deployment's own `pipeline/post_repair.py`, which binds all four and keeps
# the old signatures, so that not one caller changed in this slice.
