"""Deterministic exemplar selection: which 3-5 pieces of real writing ride in THIS prompt.

Selection exists because dumping the whole corpus recreates the monolith (Stage 0:
55k of voice produced posts 21/22 outside the founder's own sentence-length band).
Three properties, each load-bearing and each tested:

- DETERMINISTIC: same (corpus, counter, slot) -> same selection. A test can assert
  the exact ids; a provenance row can explain "why these" in one line.
- ROTATING: keyed to a caller-supplied counter (the postbook's per-channel count),
  plus the slot index within a multi-slot day. Consecutive posts get different
  exemplar sets by construction -- the structural defense against the engine's
  measured uniformity failure (7/22 posts opening "Three ...").
- FORM-MATCHED: a post slot gets post-shaped exemplars first. Stage 0 measured why:
  article excerpts teach article rhythm (mixed-corpus bands hid a 21/22 failure
  that post-only bands exposed).

    the corpus carried it, curation flipped it, and selection never read it, so
    a hype-register post ("It's ALIVE!!!") sat as an anchor in every linkedin
    prompt while believing it was retired. Absent or null keeps the row live --
    retirement is an explicit act, recorded on the row with a reason.

    LENGTH PROMOTES article-excerpt INTO THE PRIMARY TIER (2026-08-13). An article

    slot and wrong for a long one. Measured before changing it: with linkedin's 12
    post rows against k=4, `resolved_pool` never reached fallback, so all 18
    article-excerpt rows were unreachable at EVERY counter -- including sample-05

    validators used to re-derive it by counting primary-kind rows, which is only
    the same thing above k -- so they printed statements that were false about

    whole prompt from 20-word tweets and came back in the wrong register.

    NEAREST-LENGTH, NOT A THRESHOLD (2026-08-14). The first version split the corpus
    at LONG_WORDS=150. That was defensible when the x corpus ran 5..55 with a single
    479-word outlier: any cut inside that gap gave the same partition. Then the
    founder banked a 139-word post, and 150 put it in the same band as a 5-word
    tweet -- so asking for exactly that register still returned tweets. The corpus
    has THREE registers now (tweets, ~139, long-form) and a binary cannot hold three.

    Ranking by distance needs no constant, so there is nothing to re-measure and
