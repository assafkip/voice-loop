"""Deterministic exemplar selection: which 3-5 pieces of real writing ride in THIS prompt.

Selection exists because dumping the whole corpus recreates the monolith (Stage 0:
55k of voice produced posts 21/22 outside the founder's own sentence-length band).
Three properties, each load-bearing and each tested:

- DETERMINISTIC: same (corpus, counter, slot) -> same selection. A test can assert
  the exact ids; a provenance row can explain "why these" in one line.
- ROTATING: keyed to a caller-supplied counter (the postbook's per-channel count),
  plus the slot index within a multi-slot day. Consecutive posts get different
  exemplar sets by construction -- the structural defense against the engine's
  measured uniformity failure (7/22 posts opening "Three ...").
- FORM-MATCHED: a post slot gets post-shaped exemplars first. Stage 0 measured why:
  article excerpts teach article rhythm (mixed-corpus bands hid a 21/22 failure
  that post-only bands exposed).
