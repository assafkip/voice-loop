"""Reject text that is the ASSISTANT talking, not a post. The deliberation gate.

why this exists (2026-08-06): a live run published this to LinkedIn, under the founder's
name, and all eight existing gates passed it:

    "I'm not going to write this one as-is. The source material is an internal incident
     report about a bug in your own automation ... That's a real content choice, not a
     formatting task, and it's yours to make, not mine to make silently."
     ...
    "My call: **A**. The mechanism is genuinely useful ..."
    "Which one? Say A, B, or park, and I write it. If A, one thing I need from you: ..."

The model REFUSED the job and asked the founder a question. The refusal was published as
the post. It also said "a bug in ASK's own tooling" in public.

## Why nothing caught it

Every gate in the stack asks about the WRITING. `post_repair` asks if the prose is clean,
`substance_gate` if there is a number and a mechanism, `ending_gate` how it closes,
`bio_gate` and `figure_gate` whether the claims are true, `name_gate` whose name is in it.
`source_shape` is the closest -- it catches RAW MINED MATERIAL that was never rewritten --
but this text was not mined. It was generated. It is fluent, first-person, correctly
punctuated, ends on a question, and contains no client name and no false claim.

Nothing asked the only question that would have caught it: **is this addressed to the
reader, or to the operator?**

## The honest split, stated the way name_gate and ending_gate state theirs

- **EXACT (`_refusal_signals`).** The model declining or deferring the task. "I'm not
  going to write", "yours to make, not mine", "I need from you", "say A, B, or park".
  Zero judgement: these are never a post, in any context, on any channel.
- **EXACT (`_meta_signals`).** Text that talks ABOUT the writing task rather than to a
  reader: "the source material", "the hard rules", "as-is", "the prompt". A post is about
  the work; these are about producing the post.
- **EXACT (`_markdown_signals`).** Bold markers and heading syntax. Neither LinkedIn nor X
  renders markdown, so `**A**` reaching a timeline is either assistant formatting or a
  leaked template. Cheap, and it fired on the real incident.
- **HEURISTIC (`_option_menu_signals`), and it is labelled one.** An A/B/C menu with a
  recommendation. This is the shape of the incident, but a legitimate post could number
  three options for a reader, so it needs two of three markers before it counts.

## What this does NOT do

**It cannot tell a refusal from a well-written post about refusing.** A post that opens
"I told a client I'm not going to build that" is about the founder's work, not the
model's, and this gate will flag it. That is a deliberate false-positive bias: the cost of
a blocked good post is one refilled slot, and the cost of a miss is the founder's timeline.

**It reads phrasing, not intent.** A model that declines in words this list does not carry
passes. The list grows from real incidents rather than from imagination, the same way
`ending_gate`'s closer list did.

# This file already made this exact fix once. "should i" / "shall i" / "want me to" were
# added and removed within the hour on 2026-08-06 because they ate a real founder draft,

    why this is public (2026-08-09, archive-validity-joins-ledger): a caller needed
    "did the model decline the task" WITHOUT the meta/markdown/option-menu signals,
    and reached into `_refusal_signals` directly. That skipped the normalization
    below, so the same refusal text was caught with a straight apostrophe and
    missed with a curly one -- the default quote style of every model in this
    stack, and the exact scar `violations`' docstring already records. A private
    name is an invitation to re-derive the prelude; this is the prelude, once.

    The breadth matters and is why `violations` was not simply reused: over the 33
    valid published bodies, the full set fires on 4 and this fires on 1. The three
    extras trip on `_meta_signals`, which matches the substring "the draft" and is
    correct for a generation-time gate and far too broad for deciding whether an
    already-published body belongs in a measurement corpus.

    That 1-of-33 is a fact about THIS CORPUS, not a statement of detection power, and
    the distinction was worth writing down (adversarial review round 2). This is a
    deny-list of one incident's vocabulary. It misses ordinary paraphrases -- "I can't
    write this post from an internal incident report", "This one is a no from me" --
    and it always will, because `assistant_gate` reads PHRASING, not intent, and grows
    from real incidents. Read a clean result as "no known refusal phrasing", never as
    "not a refusal".
