"""Read a founder's voice/ directory. Degrade, never die.

The daily job that consumes this runs unattended in launchd. The contract, paid
for by an earlier fix and its cousins: a missing file is LESS GUIDANCE, a corrupt JSONL
row is SKIPPED AND COUNTED, and nothing on this read path raises. The counts ride
back to the caller so a deadman check can surface decay instead of a crash hiding
it. Loud failure belongs to the VALIDATOR (validate.py), which runs in a pytest
suite at edit time, not inside the publishing run.
