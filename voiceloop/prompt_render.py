"""Prompt plumbing: strip what the model prepended, count what it was told, run it.

why these three (2026-09-05, VoiceLoop package extraction, slice 11). Every operator
strips the same model preamble, counts constraints the same way, and shells the same
binary. None of that is anyone's copy.

WHAT DELIBERATELY STAYED BEHIND, and the plan expected two of them here.

`format_rules` and `render_constraints` render Amber's copy, and both pull deployment
data to do it: `format_rules` reads `config/channel-guidance.json` through
`channel_guidance` and the corpus through `form.writer_guidance`. Moving them would
have meant an adapter whose only job is to hand the engine two values back, in exchange
for relocating text that `.claude/rules/social-belongs-to-amber.md` says is a different
owner's work. The trade is bad in both directions, so they stayed and the commit says so.

`CLAUDE_BIN` did not come either, and that one is not a judgement call.
`os.path.expanduser("~/.local/bin/claude")` at module level in a package that ships
fleet-wide is one machine's path in every instance, and `drift_check.probe_unisolated_live_paths`
exists to block exactly that. `run_model` therefore takes `claude_bin` as a REQUIRED
argument here; the deployment holds the path and passes it.
