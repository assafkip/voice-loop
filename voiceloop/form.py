"""Is this draft SHAPED like him. The other half of the voice question.

`luar_scorer` answers "does this sound like him" by embedding a draft against his
corpus. Nothing answered "is it shaped like him", and the gap was invisible for the
same reason the gate gap was: every one of the 14 gates in `decide._violations` is a
NEGATIVE check, and the assembled voice section is 15,000 characters describing
REGISTER. Measured 2026-08-20, that section says "characters" 0 times, "hook" 0
times, "first line" 0 times. The machinery knew who was writing and had no opinion
about what shape the thing should be.

Found the hard way: one post ran twelve drafts and four founder rejections of the
hook. Every draft opened with a 20-30 word sentence. His own median is 9. Nothing
could see it, so nobody could say it.

## Everything here is DERIVED, never copied

The bands come from `voice/exemplars.jsonl` at call time. A hardcoded median is a
second source of truth that drifts the moment he writes another post, which is the
derivation split this repo keeps writing scars about. `founder-research` numbers
(section 14g of `canonical/social-writing-method.md`) CALIBRATE and never override:
where his corpus and the research disagree, his corpus wins, because
`social-writing-method.md` note 12 puts voice above every other instruction.

They mostly agree. Measured 2026-08-20 on posts only: LinkedIn median 808 chars
(research window 800-1000), hook median 9 words (research 8-12), 1 sentence per
paragraph (research 1-2).

## kind == "post" ONLY, and that is the whole reason these numbers are usable

The LinkedIn corpus holds 24 posts, 10 article-excerpts and 3 comments. Including
the excerpts moves the median from 808 to 756 and stretches the range to 2449, which
reads as "he writes long" and is an artifact of measuring articles as if they were
posts. The first read of this corpus made exactly that mistake and concluded his
corpus DISAGREED with the research. It does not. A form reference built from the
wrong population is worse than none: it would have taught the generator to write
articles.
