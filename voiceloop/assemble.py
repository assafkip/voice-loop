"""Assemble the voice section of a generation prompt from a loaded Voice.

Order is the design (voice-architecture PRD, 2026-08-06), and each position is a
decision:

    identity -> pov -> lexicon positives -> EXEMPLARS -> active corrections

- Exemplars sit LAST-but-one, adjacent to the source material the caller appends:
  the strong context position ("lost in the middle" is why 19k of samples inside a
  57k prompt taught nothing).
- Corrections load LAST: recency weight, the coded replacement for gotchas.md's
  "loaded last, overrides" convention.
- The lexicon contributes ONLY its positive slices (prefer/voiceprint_terms). The
  banned lists live in gate scripts; restating them in the prompt is negative
  priming, and `test_prompt_gate_coherence` in the consuming repo asserts absence.

Returns (text, provenance). Provenance carries exemplar ids, correction ids, the
selection reason and the exemplar BODIES -- the bodies feed the echo gate, which
must compare the final text against exactly what the prompt showed the model.

#: Corrections carrying this source were derived from aggregate performance
#: research on OTHER accounts, not from the founder correcting his own draft.
#: They render as options under their own header instead of the override header,
#: because "posts he has written" and his own corrections are measurements of HIM,
#: while an external lift number is a hypothesis about what might also work for
#: him. Unmarked rows render exactly as they always did, so a corpus that never
#: uses this field behaves byte for byte as before (ASK fleet-wide).
