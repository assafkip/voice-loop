"""Run the LUAR embedding in the DECLARED environment, from an interpreter that
does not have it (from a real defect).

## The problem this solves

`gate_post.py` runs under the repo interpreter (homebrew python 3.14). torch
publishes no wheels for 3.14, so `TransformersBackend._load()` raises, the gate's
failure contract turns that into `authorship: null`, and the metric reads as
permanently broken. Before this module the only way to get a number was to
hand-type

    uv run --python 3.12 --with torch --with transformers --with numpy --with einops ...

which is a dependency declaration that exists only in somebody's shell history.
That is the same class as a lazy import that works on one machine: the thing that
makes it run is not in the repo.

## The shape

One subprocess, one JSON exchange, one declared requirements file:

    parent (repo interpreter, no torch)
      -> uv run --python 3.12 --with-requirements requirements-authorship.txt
           python3 luar_env_backend.py --worker
      -> child (declared env, has torch) imports luar_scorer.TransformersBackend

THE CHILD RUNS THE SAME `TransformersBackend` THIS REPO ALREADY HAD. That is the
load-bearing part, not an implementation detail. The scorer contract pins
`max_length`/`truncation` to exactly one site and `backend.encode` to exactly one
caller; a worker that re-implemented tokenization would satisfy both detectors
(they read luar_scorer.py) while silently computing a different number in the one
path a human actually runs. Crossing a process boundary must not fork the
contract, so the worker imports it instead of restating it.

## Why this file holds BOTH sides of the protocol

The spawner and the worker are one file on purpose. They agree on a wire format,
and a wire format split across two files drifts the first time one side gains a
key. There is no import cycle risk: the worker half only runs under `--worker`.

## What is deliberately NOT here

No caching, no warm pool, no batching. A `gate_post.py` run pays one model load
(~20s warm). That is a human-in-the-loop command run a few times a day, and the
daily posting lane never reaches this file at all because `drift_report`'s
`authorship` default is False. Optimizing an unmeasured cost would add state to
a path whose whole value is that it has none.
