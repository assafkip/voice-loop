"""The substance gate. Today it enforces exactly ONE thing: a per-channel word floor.

Read that first line carefully, because this module's name and its history both promise
more than the code does, and the gap is deliberate.

`check()` returns a BLOCKING row only for a body under the word floor (5 words on X, 20 on
LinkedIn). The number requirement is GONE, retired 2026-08-11. The mechanism warn is
GONE, retired 2026-08-26 after it fired on 26 of 28 of his X posts.

why the module exists at all (2026-08-05, an earlier fix): the founder called this build "the
decision maker", and `canonical/the-business.md` plus `output/business-plan-publishing.md`
both named one rule as the moat the publishing business rests on:

    No post ships without a measured number and a named mechanism.

That rule has since been reversed twice by the founder, in 2026-08-09 (block -> warn) and
2026-08-11 (retired). Neither canonical file has been updated, so both still assert the
original. When they disagree with this module, this module is what runs.

The rule lived only in prose. **The engine could ship a post that passed every voice
lint, sounded exactly like the founder, and said nothing checkable.** The decision maker
decided voice and never decided substance.

## What each half is worth, stated honestly

**The NUMBER half is fully deterministic and strong.** A numeral must be BOUND: bound to
a denominator (`648 of 776`), to a rate (`55%`), to a timeframe (`95 times in 30 days`),
or to money (`$40,560`). A bare count is not enough and a vague quantifier is a failure,
which is the whole point of the plan's line: "so `648 of 776` and never `most`".

**The NUMBER half is NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT** (added 2026-08-06, an earlier fix).
This module asks whether a number is BOUND. It has never asked where the number came
from, and that gap is not theoretical: the fabricated-biography post scored well HERE
because "12 years" and "51,000+ lines" are numbers bound to a unit. The gate rewarded the
fabrication for being numerate. `figure_gate.check` is the other half and it asks the
question this one structurally cannot -- does this figure appear in the artifact the post
claims to come from. Both run in `decide._violations`; neither is enough alone.

**The MECHANISM half is a HEURISTIC and is labelled as one.** No regex can truly tell
whether a sentence names a causal mechanism. This checks for a mechanism marker, which
catches the common failure (a number with no explanation attached) and will miss a
mechanism phrased in a way the marker list does not cover. The real backstop for
semantic quality is the ported `voice_judge`, which catches AI *shape* the regex lints
cannot. Claiming this half is deterministic would be the same overclaim the practice
gets paid to find in other people's systems.

## Terminal behaviour

A failing candidate routes to the existing `discarded_replaced` state and the slot
refills in the same cycle. **This module adds a REASON to reject and no new terminal
state**, so `test_no_refusal_path.py` still holds: nothing is refused, nothing is held,
nothing waits.

# words, and 10 banked at 195 to 227. Then two banked bodies at 5 and 9 words, which were
# the model's own refusal text leaking through as posts -- "No correctable post exists
# here." and "The AI is confidently wrong about what it built." Both cleared every gate,
# because the only length rule in the stack was a fragment floor set deliberately low so
# it could never fight X's researched 100-character target.
