"""The form checker as ENGINE code: measurements are pure, corpus reads are bound.

why this file exists (2026-09-05, package extraction slice 4b). `form` split. The
measurements stayed whole and moved here; the corpus RESOLUTION stayed in the
deployment. The deployment's `test_form.py` still covers the adapter half
(`corpus_path`, the env override, the two candidate directory names), and it stopped
shipping to the mirror because none of those exist over here -- the mirrored copy
failed at collection with "module 'voiceloop.form' has no attribute 'corpus_path'"
and the exporter refused the commit.

So this file covers what that one now structurally cannot: that the engine works
with NO deployment present, and that it refuses rather than guesses when nobody
tells it where the corpus is.

THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS. `corpus_path()` used to resolve from `__file__`. Moving
the file would silently have repointed it at `plugins/voiceloop/voice/exemplars.jsonl`,
which does not exist, and every band would have come back computed from an empty
corpus. Empty is this module's chosen degradation for a missing file, so nothing
would have raised and no test would have failed. That is why the readers now take a
required path: the failure has to be loud, at the call site, on the first call.
