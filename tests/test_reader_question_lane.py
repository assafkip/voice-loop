"""One lane may lift the closing-question rule; every other caller keeps it.

why (2026-10-05). A founder lifted "never end on a question" for one scheduled
lane after a controlled study measured an open question at +53% replies. The rule
lives in two places: `ending_gate` (the gate) and an active correction rendered by
`assemble.voice_section` (the prose). Lifting one and not the other is the defect
that kept the lane at 0% questions for three rounds, so both halves are tested
here, and each default is pinned so no other caller changes.
