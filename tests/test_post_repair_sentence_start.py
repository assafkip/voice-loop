"""The sentence-start repair capitalizes the word that STARTS the sentence, not the first
place that word appears in the draft.

Reported 2026-09-29 from live Reddit drafts: "from The abuse side", "the rest Of your list",
"It's almost never" mid-sentence. `repair` found a lowercase sentence start, then ran
`pattern.subn(..., count=1)` over the whole raw text, which rewrites the word's FIRST
occurrence anywhere. With up to 10 passes, common words ("the", "of", "it") got capitalized
in the middle of earlier sentences while the real sentence start stayed lowercase.
