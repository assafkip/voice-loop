"""Reject a post that ends like a marketer. The closing gate.

why this exists (2026-08-05, an earlier fix): the founder read the two posts that went live that
afternoon and asked "I don't remember that a CTA was allowed at the end of any of my posts
-- wasn't there a rule for that". There was. In two places. Neither was executable.

## The rule, both places it already lived

`my-project/icp-working.md:1641`, the operator-vs-marketer table written 2026-08-04:

    | The marketers post              | The operator posts instead        |
    | ends in a CTA to a course/call  | ends in nothing, or ONE SPECIFIC THING |

founder-voice SKILL.md rules 6 and 7: "Questions expose uncomfortable truths, not drive
engagement. Questions should make the reader uncomfortable, not curious." And: end with a
direct question or a sharp statement -- never "Thoughts?" or "Agree?".

## What shipped anyway, and why nothing caught it

    LinkedIn 6a73c855f76c3f806af32ffa
      "What's the most tedious, repeatable task in your work that you wish a
       machine could just handle?"

    X 6a73cbbaf76c3f806af33647
      "...that's exactly what this solves."

Both cleared four gates with zero violations, because no gate read the ENDING. voice-lint
reads banned words, emdashes, capitalization and stat citations. `substance_gate` reads for
a number and a mechanism. `source_shape` reads for un-rewritten mined material.
`name_gate` reads for a person. The last line of a post was unexamined territory.

## The honest split, stated the way `name_gate` and `substance_gate` state theirs

- **EXACT (`_solicitation_signals`).** A closed list of closers that solicit a reply, a
  follow, or a booking. Zero judgement: "thoughts?", "let me know", "DM me", "book a
  call", "link in bio", "follow for more". These are marketer boilerplate in any context.
- **EXACT (`_pitch_close_signals`).** The pitch wearing a sentence: "that's exactly what
  this solves", "that's what I do", "if you're a <role> who ... that's". The X post's
  closer is this shape, and it reads as prose, which is what let it through.
- **HEURISTIC (`_reader_survey_signals`), and labelled as one.** A final question asking
  the reader to NOMINATE something from their own situation: a superlative or a
  "one thing" plus a second-person possessive. "What's the MOST tedious task in YOUR
  work?" is a survey. The first version of this layer fired on any interrogative closer
  containing "you", and it rejected "How many of the checks in your pipeline have ever
  been seen to reject something?" -- a dagger, and one the skill explicitly permits. The
  superlative is what makes it a poll rather than an accusation.

## A closing question IS banned outright (2026-08-06, [USER-DIRECTED])

Founder: "Ban closing questions outright on X and LinkedIn and even on substack.
essentially on any social posts I don't finish with a question."

This REVERSES the paragraph that stood here, which read "a closing question is NOT banned
outright" and cited founder-voice rule 7. The reversal is evidence-driven. Measured across
both corpora on his instruction:

    writing-samples.md  1 of 27 samples ends on a question -- and that one is a line
                        INSIDE a piece, quoting what a CISO asks, not his closer
    seed drafts         4 of 11, all from March 2026, all second person, all about the
                        reader's own business

So in his published writing he essentially never ends on a question. The four that do are
the March LinkedIn drafts written to farm engagement, and they are the closest thing in
his corpus to the survey shape he objected to on 2026-08-05.

The earlier layers were built on the opposite premise, and the March drafts were used as
the control set that proved them safe. That was the error: rule 7 is an assertion, the
corpus is evidence, and they disagreed.

`_reader_survey_signals` is kept and still runs. It is now a strictly narrower case of the
outright ban, retained because its violation message names WHY a survey is worse than an
ordinary question, and the reviser reads that message.

## Repairable, never fatal

An ending is the single most rewritable part of a post: the body's reporting is untouched
and only the last line changes. So every violation here goes to the bounded reviser with
the offending closer quoted.

That is held by two executables, not by this paragraph:
`tests/test_ending_gate.py::test_the_ending_rule_is_never_fatal` asserts
`"marketer-ending" not in decide.FATAL_RULES`, and
`::test_a_marketer_ending_is_revised_and_the_slot_still_fills` drives a real candidate
through `decide.decide_candidate` with a reviser and asserts it ships.

    does not reverse it. What he banned was a closing question tacked onto a developed

    Amber's spec has five conditions. FOUR of them are string-length and regex checks and
    are implemented here exactly as written: sole sentence, under 160 chars, no CTA verb,
    and `_reader_survey_signals` still running (that one lives in `signals`, which never
    stops calling it).

    The fifth, CARRIES A SCENE, is not checkable this way and this function does not
    pretend it is. A regex cannot tell a concrete moment from an abstract prompt dressed
    to look like one. That requirement is carried by the PROMPT -- the STORY IS THE
    PACKAGE frame added the same day -- which is the same posture `opener_gate`'s
    docstring already concedes for a line that is "followable but boring".

    So a false pass is possible by design: a question that is short and CTA-free with no
    real scene in it will clear this. That is named here rather than hidden, because
    judgment the gate cannot see is not judgment the gate should pretend to see. It is
