"""X's own format rules, as a gate. Item 4b: LENGTH.

why this exists (prd-content-engine-sameness-2026-08-09, item 4): `build_prompt` took
no channel until item 4a, so every X slot was written against LinkedIn's rules -- "120
to 250 words", which is roughly 700 characters, on a channel that takes 280.

## The size of the problem, with its denominator stated

**29 of 29 MEASURABLE X bodies are over 280.** Not most. All of them. The shortest is
981 and the longest is 1428, so the 981-char body the parent PRD offers as an example
is the MINIMUM, not an outlier.

The denominator matters and the first version of this docstring got it wrong, in the
exact way the sibling issue in this PRD was built to prevent. It said "30 of 30
published X bodies", measured with `postbook.archived_rows()`. That is the UNREFUSING
path. `postbook.corpus_bodies("x")` exists to answer this question and REFUSES to,
naming three published X posts with no archived body -- so a rate over the archive is
a rate over a silently reduced denominator, which is the move
`archive-validity-joins-ledger` withdrew a claim for one issue earlier. Caught by the
adversarial review; recorded here rather than quietly corrected.

The honest population: **32** distinct published X post ids, of which **29** have an
archived body and 3 do not, plus 1 archived X row with no published-X ledger row at
all. So "no X post the engine has published would pass this gate" is a claim about 32
backed by 29, and it is written that way on purpose.

## Why a gate and not just a line in the prompt

`generate.py:130`'s own comment already records the answer: a model told "output only
the post" still opens with "Here's the post:" often enough that it has to be stripped
rather than requested. An instruction is a request. This is the enforcement.

## Scope

LENGTH only. Paragraph shape is editorial, not an X platform limit, so short posts and
long-form X articles are both valid. Hashtag / emoji / in-body-link rules have their
own fixtures because they fail in unrelated ways.

# FOUNDER-DIRECTED 2026-08-09, verbatim: "I have x premium. I can do more than 280
# chars." This account is on X Premium, so the hard limit is 25,000 weighted units and
# NOT 280.
#
# The correction matters more than the number. This gate shipped with a 280 BLOCK, and
# 280 is not a limit for this account -- it is an editorial preference. Measured: it
# would have rejected all 29 measurable published X bodies, min 981, max 1428. A gate
# that rejects 100% of the founder's own published writing is not enforcing a platform
# rule, it is silently imposing an editorial one nobody agreed to. The tier was flagged
# as an unverified premise (from a real defect) precisely because nobody had recorded it; the
# founder answered, and the shipped answer was wrong.
X_MAX_CHARS = 25000

# The RESEARCHED target, and it is not the platform limit.
#
# `platforms.md` (the same audience research best-times.json is built on) says of X:
# "Tweets under 100 characters get more engagement." That is a reach finding, not a
# rule about what fits, and it is the only X-specific length evidence this fleet holds.
#
# Measured against it, every X post ever published here is a LinkedIn post: word counts
# run 187 to 253 against a prompt that said "120 to 250 words", because X had no format
# of its own until 2026-08-09 and inherited LinkedIn's. 27 of 29 sit inside LinkedIn's
# range. The shortest is 981 characters, roughly ten times the researched target.
#
# TARGET, not a cap, and deliberately NOT a per-post violation row.
#
# It reaches the model through the PROMPT and is measured in `sameness.report`. It was
# briefly a warn_only gate row and that was wrong: warnings are recorded to the postbook,
# nearly every post exceeds 100 characters, so it fired on almost everything and wrote a
# ledger row each time. A signal that fires constantly is the cry-wolf failure this
# codebase keeps writing scars about, and a gate here would be the checklist mistake
# again in a new costume.
#
# The founder has Premium so nothing truncates until 25,000. The research earns a nudge
# in the instruction and a number in the report, never a veto.
X_TARGET_CHARS = 100

# The timeline FOLD, not a limit. X collapses a long post behind "Show more" at roughly
# this length, so the ending every other gate just checked is not the ending a scrolling
# reader sees. That is worth reporting and is never worth killing a slot for, so it is a
# `warn_only` row -- the same posture voicefp_gate uses for a degraded engine. Reported,
# never blocking.
X_FOLD_CHARS = 280

# X does NOT count characters, and `len()` was wrong in BOTH directions (adversarial
# review, 4b). It counts WEIGHTED units after NFC normalisation: the ranges below weigh

#
# Measured against the real rule:
#   a 200-char Japanese body  -> len 200, weighs 400 -> PASSED a gate X would truncate
#   a 158-char emoji run      -> len 158, weighs 288 -> PASSED a gate X would truncate
#   a body with a 54-char URL -> len 305, weighs 274 -> DISCARDED a post that fits
#
# The false negative is the gate failing at its one job: a post it passes still loses
# the ending, which the violation text explicitly promises to protect.
