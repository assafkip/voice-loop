"""Echo detection: the candidate must not parrot what its own prompt showed it.

why this exists (2026-08-06, Stage 0 finding 2): 9 of 22 posts published in one day
contained the literal sentence pair "Nothing was sent. Nothing was lost." -- the
EXAMPLE ending inside `revise.RULE_GUIDANCE`. The reviser copied its own guidance
example into published text, and nothing compared output against what the prompt
carried. Loading exemplars into prompts (the whole voice architecture) makes this
class WORSE unless it is gated, so the gate ships with the loader.

Two checks, both pure text ops:

- `prompt_echo`: any N-gram (default 8 words) shared between the candidate and any
  text that rode in its prompt (exemplars, guidance examples). 8 is deliberate: long
  enough that a shared idiom ("the same thing happened to us") cannot fire, short
  enough that a lifted sentence cannot hide.
- `opener_echo`: the candidate's first sentence shape vs recent published openers.
  First-6-word overlap of 4+ tokens = the same opener. 7/22 posts opening "Three
  receipts/drafts/duplicate..." is the measured failure.
