"""Per-run usage ledger for every headless `claude -p` call (from a real defect).

The fleet runs on one Claude subscription. Until this file existed nothing
recorded which bot spent what: on 2026-09-12 the weekly limit hit, every job
went dark, and the attempts ledger charged 23 issues as TERMINAL for it. The
founder's fear, verbatim: a bot "keeps creating tickets for the sake of creating
tickets and then it worked for a week and killed my tokens." A cap needs a meter
first. This is the meter.

How it works, and what it promises to callers:

- The wrapper adds `--output-format json` to the call. `finish()` turns that
  JSON back into EXACTLY the text a plain `-p` call printed (`result` plus the
  trailing newline; measured 2026-09-22, both forms captured in the test
  fixture), so no caller sees a different byte.
- One row per run, the failures included, is appended to
  `~/.config/voiceloop/usage-ledger.jsonl` (override: `VOICE_LOOP_USAGE_LEDGER`).
  Machine-local, outside every repo. A call that returned nothing to its caller
  (timeout, non-zero exit, refusal) still leaves a `failure_row`, because a
  blackout that leaves no rows reads as an idle fleet (a review review).
- Nothing here can fail a run. A stdout that is not the expected JSON is
  handed back as the plain prose a `-p` call would have printed and recorded
  as `parse_error`; a ledger that cannot be written is skipped. A meter that
  kills the job it meters is worse than none.
- No model call, no network. Pure functions over text, plus one append.
