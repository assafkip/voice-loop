"""The authorship scoring contract, in ONE module so two implementations cannot
disagree (prd-voice-authorship-scoring-2026-08-17, a reviewerfinding-1).

The metric answers the one question the ten surface gates structurally cannot
approach: does this draft SIT NEAR his exemplar corpus in an authorship
embedding. That is corpus similarity -- evidence about authorship, never a
verdict on it. The 2026-08-18 decontamination is the standing proof of the gap:
every field of every record was computed correctly for a month while the
reference described templated marketing copy instead of him (from a real defect).
Human-facing surfaces say "corpus similarity"; the `authorship_*` record keys
stay, as a recorded shape. It is ADVISORY FOREVER under that PRD
-- it never enters a blocking tier, and nothing here can fail a draft.

## Why every clause below is pinned by a test rather than by this docstring

Each was measured on 2026-08-17 against the real corpus before any code existed
(`social-voice/q-system/output/luar-separation/`). The measurement is what makes
them non-negotiable, and a prose contract nobody executes is how two callers end
up computing two different numbers under one name.

- **Tokenization: single-document, 512-token truncation.** The chunk shape is NOT
  the contract and the difference is not cosmetic: short-band AUC is 0.883 single
  and 0.702 chunked against generic output, 0.836 versus 0.584 against other
  humans. So the emitted record NAMES the shape it used; a future change cannot
  silently move every number that was ever logged.
- **Combining exemplars: mean of per-document embeddings, then cosine.** Not
  cosine-of-concatenation (one long exemplar would dominate the region) and not
  mean-of-pairwise-cosines (a different statistic, and the one the 2026-08-17
  experiment happened to use for its AUC feature).
- **Reference: the per-length-band leave-one-out MEDIAN**, never p10. p10 was
  written into the PRD, then measured and falsified: at p10 the share of generic
  control drafts clearing his own floor is 39.4% short, 92.9% mid, 100% long,
  because his weakest real posts sit below the entire control distribution and
  set the floor. Against the median, 0% of long controls and 3% of short controls
  clear the line.
- **Band by the draft's OWN word count**, at the cuts the experiment used: short
  under 60, mid 60 to 150, long over 150. Banding is per length band only --
  pooled AUC (0.664) is worse than either band alone because cosine scale rises
  with length, and the channel x band cell counts (two cells hold a single row)
  forbid the finer split.
- **Mid gets a number and an explicitly null reference.** Excluded from BANDING
  (0.699/0.694, inconclusive under both tokenizations) is not excluded from
  scoring. Emitting a score against a reference nobody trusts would be worse than
  emitting no reference at all.

## torch is not a dependency of this module's import

`TransformersBackend` is the ONLY code here that touches torch/transformers, and
it imports them inside `_load()`. Importing this module, and every pure function
in it, works in an environment with neither. That is load-bearing twice over: the
319MB model must never load inside the scheduled posting lane, and the contract
tests must be able to run in the repo's own interpreter, which has no torch.

The tokenizer/model call shape is lifted verbatim from the experiment's
`Embedder.embed` (`run_experiment.py`, episode shape "single") rather than
rewritten, because the measured numbers belong to that exact shape -- including
embedding one text at a time so the episode axis stays (1, E, L).
