"""Every NUMBER in a post must exist in the post's own source artifact. The figure gate.

why this exists (2026-08-06, an earlier fix): `provenance.py` proves a source EXISTS. It
does not prove the text FOLLOWS FROM it, and it says so in its own docstring. Sal's
adversarial read of the first post produced under the provenance regime demonstrated the
gap on real output rather than in the abstract: the post resolved cleanly against commit
213d7f1b and still described the March draft in terms softer than the record.

`substance_gate` made that worse in a way worth naming. It REQUIRES a bound number and
treats finding one as the post doing its job. It never asks where the number came from.
That is how "51,000+ lines across those systems" scored as a STRENGTH on the fabricated
biography: the fabrication was numerate, and numerate was the whole test.

So the number half of the substance rule is now NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT. A post
must carry a bound number (substance_gate) AND every figure it carries must be traceable
to the artifact its provenance names (this module).

## What is deterministic here, and it is only this

A numeral either occurs in the artifact text or it does not. That is a string lookup,
the same class of thing `provenance.resolve` does, and it is the entire mechanism.

Two DERIVATIONS are allowed. Both are arithmetic and neither is a judgement:

- fraction -> percent: the artifact says `648 of 776`, the post says `84%`.
- percent -> fraction: the artifact says `80%`, the post says `4 of 5`.

The second direction is not decorative. `revise.RULE_GUIDANCE["stats-citation"]`
instructs the reviser to restate a bare percentage as its underlying count, in those
exact words, with those exact examples. Without this derivation the repair ladder would
manufacture text that this gate then rejects -- two gates fighting, one slot lost per
collision, and the failure would read as a sourcing problem rather than as the gate
interaction it is. Found by writing the interaction test before the code.

## What this does NOT do, stated plainly because the last docstring that overclaimed is
## the reason this module exists

**It cannot see a fact that is ABSENT.** The incident that motivated this module was
softening by OMISSION: a post that said the March draft "sat approved for 5 months" and
left out that the engine PUBLISHED it, verbatim, with a fabricated biography, under the
founder's name. Every figure in that post was supported by its artifact. This gate would
have passed it, and it still would today.

That half is not closed and is not closeable by inspecting the post's text: there is no
string to match on for a sentence nobody wrote. Anything claiming otherwise would be the
same overclaim in a new file.

**It matches VALUES, not MEANINGS.** Measured 2026-08-06 in this module's own
adversarial pass: an artifact reading "we ranked the top 3 subreddits" vouches for a post
saying "we cut it to 3 attempts". The digit is there; the fact is not. Narrowing this
would mean binding each figure to the noun phrase it modifies, which is parsing, which is
judgement, which is the thing this module refuses to do. So the honest statement is that
this raises the cost of inventing a number rather than making it impossible: an invented
figure now has to COLLIDE with a real one in the same artifact.

**It does not check non-numeric characterisations.** "We shipped" against a commit
authored by one person is a false attribution and this module is silent on it. Naming a
heuristic for that was considered and dropped: a first-person-plural check false-positives
on the founder's ordinary voice, which uses "we" for the practice.

**It is silent when there is no artifact.** `check(text, None)` returns no violations.
A candidate with no resolvable source is the PROVENANCE gate's job and it never reaches
here. Returning a violation here too would double-report one defect.

## The kill switch is shared, on purpose

This reads `provenance.load_mode()` rather than owning a second switch. `off` disables
both, `warn` makes both advisory, and the existing banner ("nothing is checking that a
post came from anything real") stays true either way. Two switches would mean a founder
who turned "the provenance gate" off still had half of it running, which is the kind of
half-state that makes a person stop trusting the off button.

# THE ILLUSTRATIVE EXEMPTION (2026-08-12, Amber's ruling under RULE-2026-08-12-F).
#
# The conflict she was handed: the founder said "I dont care if numbers are made up, but I
# want interesting posts", and this gate binds every numeral to the post's own artifact.
# Her ruling is deliberately narrower than his literal words, and her reason is the only
# thing that matters here: a number presented AS A MEASURED FACT is a claim a reader can
# rely on, repeat, or catch him lying about. Loosening wholesale would let a fabricated
# statistic back in with nothing but the writer's judgment between it and his name, which
# is the exact condition that produced the "51,000+ lines" incident this module exists for.
#
# So exactly one path is exempt, and it needs THREE independent conditions to hold:
#
#   ROUND        the shape of an estimate, not of a measurement
#   MARKED       the sentence says outright that the number is a stand-in
#   UNATTACHED   no real named person, company or incident in that sentence
#
# Each condition is separately load-bearing and each is separately pinned in
# `test_figure_gate_illustrative.py`: a round number stated as a finding stays refused, a
# falsely precise number inside an illustrative frame stays refused, and a round marked
# number attached to a name stays refused. Drop any one condition and one of those three
# goes green.
#
# FAIL CLOSED, in her words: "I would rather lose a good illustrative number than let one
# more fabricated 'measured' figure ship under his name." Every ambiguity below therefore
# resolves toward demanding the source match.

# number is a stand-in rather than something he found.
